Creating and Storing password
=============================
Take the user password
Generate a salt(String of random characters)
Combine the salt with the user entered password
Hash the combined string with a suitable cryptographic algorithm.
Store the result as the password and also store the salt along side.

Validating user password
=========================
Validate the username and fetch the hashed result and salt from the database
Combine the user entered password with the salt stored for that user.
Hash the combined string with the same cryptographic algorithm used at the time of creating user.
Compare the result with the stored hash.
